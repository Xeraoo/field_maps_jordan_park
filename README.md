## Introduction
The aim of this exercise was to create an application using **ESRI Field Maps** for inventorying various assets located within **Jordan Park** in Krakow. As part of the project, bench data was sourced from OpenStreetMap (OSM) and used in conjunction with ESRI Online to build layers with specific attributes and criteria to facilitate park inventory management.

## Data Selection
The inventory process involves creating a detailed list of physical assets at a specified location. Initial project planning began by identifying data suitable for inventorying, with brainstorming sessions conducted on the UPEL platform and in class. Various asset categories, such as benches, were proposed by team members as potential candidates for inventory.

## Data Collection
The collected data from **OpenStreetMap (OSM)** was imported and organized within **ESRI Online**. A Web Map was created, integrating layers and providing an **OpenStreetMap basemap** (50% transparency) for better orientation during field inventory.

## Data Export to ESRI Resources
Data exported from OSM was formatted and integrated into **ESRI resources** for more efficient inventory handling and layer customization.

## Data Processing

### Bench Data Processing
Bench-related data was adjusted to suit the inventory project. After adding the bench layer to the Web Map, symbolization was applied to clearly represent each bench's location. This symbolization, shown in the screenshot below, was selected for clarity and visibility during field mapping.

Additionally, attachments were enabled for this layer to allow photos and other media to be added directly in the field. This step was also applied to other layers to avoid redundancy in inventorying steps.

## Creating Custom Layers
Custom layers were designed based on inventory needs, enabling a tailored mapping experience for each type of asset.

## Adding Values to Layers & Generating Lists
Values were added to each layer, and lists were generated to streamline data management and retrieval.

## Layer Symbolization
The created layers were symbolized in a clear and informative way, enhancing readability and utility for field users.

## Park Inventory
The Field Maps application was used in **Jordan Park** to document park assets, utilizing symbolized layers and custom attributes.

## Numerical Summary
A quantitative summary of the parkâ€™s assets was generated based on the data collected during inventory.

## Conclusions
This exercise enhanced my proficiency with ESRI software, especially in creating maps and field applications. Testing the application firsthand provided valuable insights into the accuracy of **OpenStreetMap data** and the limitations of GPS data quality in mobile devices. 

This experience reinforced the importance of data accuracy and sensor quality, which will be crucial in future field-based GIS projects.
